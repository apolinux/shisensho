Shisen Sho
=======================

I love to play this game for years and I wanted to build a new version from the 
scratch.

This version runs only in python 3 even though there are plans to make it more
compatible with python 2.

Description
-----------

The Shisen Sho Game is a popular board game born in Japan. It uses the tiles
of another popular game from Japan: Mahjong.

The objective of the game is empty the board deleting all the tiles. The tiles 
are deleted in pairs. The tiles can be erased if there is a path of 3 points
between them. The path must be horizontally or vertically and it must be free
of any tile. Also, the path can be outside the board.

If you think the game can be improved, please let me know, I do my best effort!
